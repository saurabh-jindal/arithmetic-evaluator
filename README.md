Design and Implementation Choices:
Backend (Django):

1. API Endpoint Design:
   The backend API endpoint (evaluate_expression) is designed to handle POST requests containing arithmetic expressions.
   Expressions are sent as form data, and the endpoint evaluates them using Python's eval() function after basic validation.
   The endpoint returns the result of the evaluation as a JSON response.

2. Validation:
   Expressions are validated using a regular expression to ensure they follow a basic format (<number>+<number>-<number>...).
   Basic error handling is implemented to catch exceptions during evaluation and to handle missing or invalid expressions.

3. Unit Testing:
   A unit test case is provided to ensure the correct behavior of the evaluate_expression view.
   The test case simulates a POST request with a valid arithmetic expression and asserts that the response contains the expected result.

Additional Documentation:

1. Scalability:
   The backend API can be scaled by deploying it on a server with appropriate resources to handle increased traffic.
   The frontend can be enhanced with additional features such as error handling, real-time validation, and support for more complex arithmetic expressions.

2. Security Considerations:
   The backend should implement additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
   HTTPS should be used to encrypt communication between the frontend and backend to protect sensitive data.

3. Deployment:
   Deployment of the Django backend can be done using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, following best practices for security and scalability.
   Static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) can be served using a content delivery network (CDN) for improved performance.

4. Documentation:
   Comprehensive documentation should be provided for developers, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and usage examples.
   Code comments and docstrings should be used to explain the functionality and purpose of each component.

5. Testing:
   Besides unit tests, additional testing should be performed, including integration tests and user acceptance tests, to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
